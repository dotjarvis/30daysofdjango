## Python Tutorial  By Mosh
This tutorial introduces you to all the core concepts to getting started with python. It's like the base foundation to the entire journey. Ensure to have the core concpets well before moving forward else you will be more confused.
Take you time to learning the concepts.
You have some python knowledge? No worries just rewatch the tutorial for review. You can even watch the tutorial 2x faster if necessary. It's just important to jog your mind with the course before diving to Django.

Since we are limited to time frame don't waste much time here coz there's still have lots to cover. 

### Parts to skip
Since we have a limited time and there's need to save every second. No need watch everything in the tutorial. I promise you won't miss anything for our goal success. Tutorial link: youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc

Time stamps. 
1. -> 3:56:00 Excel Spreadsheet automation.
2. -> 4:10:58 Machine learning project.
3. -> 4:59:12 Building web app with Django framework.

My advise is watch from beginning to 3:56:00 then skip to 4:59:12. It's safe to skip the first and second projects since they don't align with our goal and will be a waste of our precious time. But you can defintely check them if you might be having interest with exploring python use cases.
