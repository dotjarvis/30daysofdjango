## Python Tutorial  By Mosh
This tutorial introduces you to all the core concepts to getting started with python. It's like the base foundation to the entire journey. Ensure to have the core concpets well before moving forward else you will be more confused.
Take you time to learning the concepts.
You have some python knowledge? No worries just rewatch the tutorial for review. You can even watch the tutorial 2x faster if necessary. It's just important to jog your mind with the course before diving to Django.

Since we are limited to time frame don't waste much time here coz there's still have lots to cover. 

### Parts to skip
Watch from beginning to [3:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=14160s) then skip to [4:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=17952s). It's safe to skip the first and second projects since they don't align with our goal and will be a waste of our precious time plus we have a limited time and there's need to save every second.

## Week 1 Talk abouts.
1. Shifting to VS code
2. Deployment on Heroku
3. Breaking down Django introduction part.
4. Getting the most from Tutorial/ How to learn

### 1. Getting Started with Django in VS code
--------------------------------------------------
From the First tutorial, we are introduced to Pycharm code editor. And most student if not all adapt to the code editor. Pycharm is great just as much as VS code, but it's easier working with HTML, CSS, JS in VS code than Pycharm, henceforth, I shift to VS code for the rest of the challange. Setting up VS code for django environment can be a nightmare especially for begginers. Here is how to get started.

1. Install VS code (if you haven't already) 
2. Download and Install python.
3. Install django framework -> run (pip install Django) command
4. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code (ctrl + shift +X) has 94M+ downloads, verified by microsoft.
5. Set up your environment (ctrl + shift +X) -> Run and debug, then select django
6. Open or create a Python file and start coding!
