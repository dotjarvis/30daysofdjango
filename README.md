# 30daysofdjango
This repo is for sharing Django learning process for 30days afterwards building a real-world project and definitely add it to resume.

## Resorces used
1. Watch Python Tutorial  By Mosh --> youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t

2. Tutorial series on django by Dennis Ivy --> youtube.com/watch?v=xv_bwpA_aEA&list=PL-51WBLyFTg2vW-_6XBoUpE7vpmoR3ztO

4. Plus any tutorial that is promising...

Don't just watch, code along to get the most.

## Python Tutorial  By Mosh
This tutorial introduces you to all the core concepts to getting started with python. It's like the base foundation to the entire journey. Ensure to have the core concpets well before moving forward else you will be more confused.
Take you time to learning the concepts.
You have some python knowledge? No worries just rewatch the tutorial for review. You can even watch the tutorial 2x faster if necessary. It's just important to jog your mind with the course before diving to Django.

Since we are limited to time frame don't waste much time here coz there's still have lots to cover. 

### Parts to skip
Since we have a limited time and there's need to save every second. No need watch everything in the tutorial. I promise you won't miss anything for our goal success. Tutorial link: youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc

Time stamps. 
1. -> 0:00:00 Core python concepts
1. -> 3:56:00 Excel Spreadsheet automation.
2. -> 4:10:58 Machine learning project.
3. -> 4:59:12 Building web app with Django framework.

My advise is watch from beginning to 3:56:00 then skip to 4:59:12. It's safe to skip the first and second projects since they don't align with our goal and will be a waste of our precious time. But you can defintely check them if you might be having interest with exploring python use cases.

## Week 1 Talk abouts.
1. Shifting to VS code
2. Deployment on Heroku
3. Breaking down Django introduction part.
4. Getting the most from Tutorial

### Getting Started with DJango in VS code
--------------------------------------------------
As part of the First tutorial, we are introduced to Pycharm code editor. And most of beginners including me adapt to this code editor. Pycharm is great just as much as VS code. But it's just easy working with HTML, CSS and JS in VS code than Pycharm; with this insight I shifted to VS code for the rest of the challnge. Having to setup everthing in VS code extensions can be a nightmare especially for begginers, Here is how i got started.

1. Install VS code ( if you haven't already) 
2. Download and Install python.
3. Install django framework -> run (pip install Django) command
4. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code (ctrl + shift +X) has 94M+ downloads, verified by microsoft.
5. Set up your environment (ctrl + shift +X) -> Run and debug, then select django
6. Open or create a Python file and start coding!
