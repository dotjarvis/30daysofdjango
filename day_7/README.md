# 1. Week 1 overview

---

First week of the challenge is done. I finished the first tutorial by Mosh Hamedani. It was quite length for sure 6+ hrs hour of content. It's also a steep learning curve especially to someone who hasn't tried coding before.

The course really gives you the core contents in python; variables, loops , lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, modules, packages plus python syntax. It also contains a brief introduction to django which is really eye opening.

I skipped some part (Python Project use cases) because I don't think it's of value to achieving my goal plus to save on time. Be sure to check them out if you are interested in python use cases, time stamps in projects readME file.

To get the most from the course one really need to;

1. Code along with the tutor.
2. Make sure you have a notebook this will really help you in reference instead of re-watching long video
3. Attempt all coding challenges offered by the tutor, you don't have to get them right, all that matters is giving it a shot.
4. Repeat a concept if need be and make sure you master it before moving forward.
5. Make sure you finish watching the tutorial especially the django project part.
6. Don't proceed to the next tutorial before making any 2 of your own mini/ dummy projects this will build your confidence and ensure you master the concepts well.
